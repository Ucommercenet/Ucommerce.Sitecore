## How to test
In order to test your steps, here's what you should do:
- Go to the command that calls your step.
- Uncomment your step in the command.
- Build a folder structure similar to what your step needs.
- If your steps need files to move, create some empty files that match the naming.
- Call the command with parameters pointing to the folder structure you made.
- Verify that changes were made by the step.
